## Graph Data API

This is a project that attempts to build a restful API for a rust project,
that interfaces with a graph backend such as a graph database or another form
of database with graph abstraction capabilitites. It is meant to be a small
prototype to experiment with these technologies, and to potentially show me
where Rust can benefit from additional library support.
