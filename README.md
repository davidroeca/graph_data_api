## Graph Data API

This is a project that attempts to build a restful API in Rust that interfaces
with a graph backend such as a graph database. It is meant to be a small
prototype to experiment with these technologies, and to potentially show me
where Rust can benefit from additional library support.

## Rust versions
Since this repository currently relies on rocket, it only runs on the nightly
build of rust. See
[rocket's documentation](https://rocket.rs/guide/getting-started/#installing-rust)
for more.
